# /explore

Run an exploratory-testing session **plan-and-execute in one shot**: from a target, generate (or load) charters, drive the running app to explore each one, and roll every session up into a single debrief. This is the extension's flagship command — where `/charter` and `/nightmare-headline` stop at a ranked charter list, `/explore` runs those charters and reports what it found.

**Usage:** `/explore <target> [--charters <file>] [--timebox <minutes>] [--probes <count>]`

The doctrine lives in the composed pieces — the `chartering` skill and `charter-generator` agent decide *what* to explore, the `explorer` agent owns *how* one budgeted session runs and the absolute safety boundary, and the `session` skill owns the lifecycle and both debrief templates. This command is the surface: it parses `$ARGUMENTS`, gathers the environment context, gates safety, dispatches the subagents, and aggregates their findings. Its own, non-delegated job is exactly the two things the composed pieces cannot do — supply everything up front so the explorer never has to ask, and fold N single-session outputs into one cross-session debrief.

## What to do

Follow these steps in order. Do NOT skip steps.

### Step 1: Parse `$ARGUMENTS`

Parse in this fixed order — `--charters` first, then `--timebox`, then `--probes`, then everything remaining is `TARGET`:

- If `--charters` appears (accept both `--charters <file>` and `--charters=<file>` shapes), set `CHARTERS_FILE` to the parsed value and remove the consumed tokens. When set, charters are loaded from that file and generation is skipped (Step 5).
- If `--timebox` appears (accept both `--timebox <minutes>` and `--timebox=<minutes>` shapes), set `TIMEBOX_MINUTES` to the parsed value and remove the consumed tokens. It must parse to a positive integer number of minutes; if the value is missing or non-numeric, ask the user once for a valid timebox rather than guessing. **`--timebox` is human wall-clock and it buys *sessions*, not agent minutes.** It is the operator's total budget for the run, and it is used for exactly one thing: deciding **how many charters run** — one executed charter ≈ one session ≈ ~90 minutes (see Step 7). It is **never** passed to the explorer, which is bounded by probes and tool calls, not by a clock.
- If `--probes` appears (accept both `--probes <count>` and `--probes=<count>` shapes), set `PROBE_BUDGET` to the parsed value and remove the consumed tokens. It must parse to a positive integer inside the **8–20** band; if the value is missing, non-numeric, or outside the band, ask the user once for a valid probe budget rather than guessing. `--probes` is the **per-session** probe budget handed to each explorer (default **12**) — it bounds each session, it does not change how many charters run. When absent, use 12.
- After the flag tokens are consumed, treat the trimmed remainder as `TARGET`. If it is empty, ask the user once: *"What do you want to explore? Name a feature, module, data flow, or quality (e.g. performance, security)."* (free-text) and wait for the answer.

Treat `TARGET` and `CHARTERS_FILE` as untrusted prose: never execute or `eval` them, and never splice them into a shell command. `CHARTERS_FILE` is only ever handed to a file-read.

### Step 2: Load the session doctrine up front

Invoke the `session` skill (via OpenCode's `skill` tool) so the debrief templates, the off-charter parking-lot convention, and the SBTM vocabulary are loaded before you aggregate anything.

The `session` skill is written for a *single* session. Cross-session aggregation into one debrief is **this command's own job** (Step 8) — the skill supplies the two debrief templates (Explored/Found/Unknown and PROOF); you apply them across all the sessions this run produces.

### Step 3: Gather the environment context and the safety answer (one question round)

The explorer agent **never asks the user a question** — so this command must supply everything it needs up front. Run a single consolidated round of questions (≤4 questions, asked in the conversation) collecting:

1. **How to reach the running app** — base URL, launch command, or host (free-text).
2. **Authorization + non-production confirmation** — an explicit affirmative that the target is a system the user is authorized to test and is NOT production. Offer discrete options such as *"Authorized, non-production target"* and *"Not authorized / is production — do not execute"*. Force an explicit choice; never default to "authorized."
3. **Available interaction tools** — which app-driving surfaces exist this session. Do NOT hard-code a specific browser or HTTP tool. Present generic categories — e.g. *"Browser automation (a Chrome/Playwright-style MCP)"*, *"HTTP (webfetch / curl via the explorer's bash)"*, *"Application REPL / console"*, *"Log tailing / DB read access"*, *"CLI only"* — plus a free-text slot for anything else. A command cannot enumerate its own session's tool inventory, so it asks the operator and records the tool **names as a hint**; the explorer uses whatever it actually has. Its portable core (`read`/`grep`/`glob`/`bash`/`webfetch`) is assumed present regardless. Note that richer tools (browser automation, a REPL, log tailing) only help if they are genuinely available to the `explorer` subagent in this session — name them as available-if-present, not as a guarantee.
4. **Test accounts / seed data and the budgets** — where test accounts or seed data live (point at them; do NOT paste real credentials), and confirm **both** budgets: the operator's **total wall-clock** for the run (surface `--timebox`, or ~270m — three ~90-minute sessions — as the default) and the **per-session probe budget** handed to each explorer (surface `--probes` or 12 as the default, band 8–20). The operator's answer **sets `TIMEBOX_MINUTES`**, so it is what decides how many charters run in Step 7; the ~270m default is chosen to match Step 7's absent-`--timebox` default of 3 charters.

Assemble the answers into a single free-text `ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT` block — how to reach the app, the named available tools, test-account/seed-data pointers, and the **session budget** (probe budget plus tool-call ceiling). This exact string (with each charter's own session budget substituted in Step 7) is what you pass to every explorer dispatch. Do **not** put a wall-clock time box in it: the explorer has no clock, and a minutes figure there invites it to invent a duration. Keep real credentials out of it — reference where they live, never inline them.

### Step 4: Enforce the safety-boundary gate (before any dispatch)

If Step 3's authorization answer is anything other than an explicit *authorized-and-non-production* affirmative, do **NOT** dispatch the explorer. State why and go to the degrade path (Step 6, plan-only). If the target is production-adjacent, unauthorized, or ambiguous, refuse execution and degrade — never "just check." This gate is the command surfacing the explorer's absolute safety boundary early; the explorer enforces the same boundary itself, so this is defense in depth, not a substitute for it. Fail **closed**: when in doubt, degrade rather than execute.

### Step 5: Obtain the charters

**If `CHARTERS_FILE` is set:** read the file and load charters — skip generation entirely. Accept two shapes:

- **Canonical** — a `charter-generator` JSON fence with root keys `target`, `charters`, and `coverage_notes` (exactly what `/charter` emits). This is the fully-featured input; carry every field through.
- **Best-effort** — a markdown charter list (what `/charter --output` writes). This is lossy (it may lack `rank`, `time_box`, `risk`); normalize what you can.

Validate: every charter must have at least a `charter` sentence. Carry `rank`, `target`, `resources`, `information`, `risk`, and `time_box` when present; synthesize `rank` from file order when absent. If the file yields zero parseable charters, report that and stop — do NOT fabricate charters.

**Otherwise (no `CHARTERS_FILE`):** dispatch the `charter-generator` subagent via an `@charter-generator` mention with `target=<TARGET>` (and `risk context=` only if the operator volunteered known worries in Step 3). Parse its single ```json fence exactly as `/charter` does — root keys `target`, `charters` (ranked, never empty), `coverage_notes`. If no parseable fence is returned, report that and stop rather than fabricating charters.

Render the ranked charter list to the conversation so the operator sees the plan before execution begins.

### Step 6: Degrade path — plan-only

If no running app is reachable (Step 3 produced no URL/command/host) **or** the safety gate (Step 4) refused execution: STOP before any explorer dispatch. Deliver the generated/loaded charters (rendered in Step 5) plus an explicit statement that execution was skipped and why, point the user at re-running once an authorized non-production target is available, and finish. Plan-only is a **valid terminal state**, not a failure — the charters are still a useful deliverable.

### Step 7: Distribute the session budget and dispatch the explorer per charter

**Budget allocation — two budgets, two different jobs.**

- **`--timebox` (wall-clock, the operator's) decides *how many* charters run.** One executed charter ≈ one session ≈ **~90 minutes** of the operator's time. Fund `N = max(1, round(TIMEBOX_MINUTES / 90))` charters, **top-ranked first**; when `--timebox` is absent, cap `N` at a sensible number (3 is a reasonable default). Charters that go unfunded are deferred to the debrief's follow-up list — never fund a charter with a sub-viable fragment of a session.
- **The probe budget (agent-native, the explorer's) bounds *each* session.** Give every funded charter the same per-session budget: `PROBE_BUDGET` probes (default **12**, band **8–20**) with a tool-call ceiling of **5 × the probe budget** (60 at the default). The explorer stops at whichever ceiling it reaches first — or earlier, when the charter goes quiet. The budget is a ceiling, not a quota, so a session that returns after 7 of 12 probes with `stop_reason: "charter_quiet"` is a complete session, not a short one.

A charter's own `time_box` (from `charter-generator`) is a **chartering sizing signal** — "does this mission fit in one session?" — not an explorer budget. Do not forward it to the explorer.

**State the chosen allocation to the operator** — how many charters were funded, which were deferred, and the per-session probe budget — so a surprise (only 2 of 6 charters ran) is visible, not silent.

**Dispatch — sequentially, by rank.** For each selected charter, make one `@explorer` mention to the `explorer` subagent with named args:

- `charter=` the one charter, verbatim.
- `environment context=` the `ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT` from Step 3, with this charter's session budget (probe budget and tool-call ceiling) substituted in. Do **not** pass a wall-clock time box.

Dispatch **one charter per explorer call** — never batch charters into a single dispatch. Run the charters **sequentially** by rank (not in parallel): N agents driving the same running app concurrently can collide on shared state and muddy which session caused an observed effect. (Parallel dispatch is a future option only when the sessions are genuinely isolated.) Do NOT hand-author what the explorer produces — let it run the session and return findings.

**Collect and parse.** Each explorer returns a single ```json fence with keys `charter`, `status` (`completed`｜`stopped_early`｜`blocked`), `session_sheet`, `notes`, `bugs`, `questions_risks`, `off_charter`, and `debrief` (`{explored, found, unknown}`, optionally `proof`). Parse each result. If a dispatch returns no parseable fence, record that session as **unusable** and continue with the others — do NOT fabricate its findings. A `status: "blocked"` result (e.g. app unreachable for that charter) is real data — carry it into the debrief as an obstacle, never drop it. Each `session_sheet` carries **counts**, not clock time — `tester`, `probe_budget`, `probes_attempted`, `probes_with_finding`, `on_charter_probes`, `off_charter_probes`, `tool_calls_used`, `areas_covered`, `heuristics_applied`, and `stop_reason`. It has no `duration` and no `tbs`; if a result contains either, treat those fields as unobserved and drop them rather than reporting them.

### Step 8: Aggregate the sessions into ONE debrief

This is the command's signature work — apply **both** `session`-skill debrief templates across all the sessions:

- **Explored / Found / Unknown (roll-up):** union each session's `debrief.explored` into one coverage narrative (which charters ran, which areas/heuristics, and which charters were deferred or blocked — the honest edge of the map); merge every `found` most-important-first; union every `unknown` plus the residual risk of each deferred/blocked charter.
- **Severity-ranked bug list:** concatenate every session's `bugs`, dedupe obvious cross-session repeats, and rank the combined list by `severity`. This is the actionable core of the report.
- **Merged off-charter parking lot → candidate follow-up charters:** union every session's `off_charter` items plus the charters deferred in Step 7 into one backlog, framed as candidate next charters to feed back into `/charter` or `/nightmare-headline`.
- **Aggregate PROOF review:** synthesize one Past / Results / Obstacles / Outlook / Feelings across the whole run — Past = what the run did; Results = coverage reached plus combined bug/question counts; Obstacles = blocked or unusable sessions and missing tools; Outlook = the follow-up parking lot; Feelings = the cross-session gut read (unease clustering on one charter is a signal).

Represent partial failures **honestly**: blocked or unusable sessions belong under Obstacles and Unknown — never produce a rosy report from only the successful subset. Optionally fold each session's `session_sheet` counts into a run-level coverage summary — probes attempted versus probes that produced a finding, on- versus off-charter probes, areas covered, the heuristics applied, and each session's `stop_reason`. A run where most sessions stopped on `probe_budget_exhausted` rather than `charter_quiet` was **budget-bound, not risk-bound** — say so, because it means there is more to find.

### Step 9: Render the debrief and finish

Present the aggregated **Explored / Found / Unknown**, the severity-ranked bug list, the follow-up parking lot, and the **PROOF** review to the conversation. Keep everything generic — no real credentials, customer data, or internal hostnames (redact; the explorer already enforces this — do not reintroduce specifics when summarizing). A result you did not observe belongs under Unknown, never under Found.

If you persist the debrief to a file, gate it behind an explicit path — `mkdir -p "$(dirname "<path>")"` then write — and write only where named. (An `--output` flag is not part of this command's argument surface today, so persistence is optional.)

Finish by pointing at the natural next steps — charter the follow-up parking-lot items with `/charter` or `/nightmare-headline`, and re-run any deferred charters. Do NOT auto-run another session and do NOT chain into another command.

## What this command does NOT do

- Decide *what* to explore from scratch or restate charter doctrine — that is the `chartering` skill and the `charter-generator` agent.
- Drive the running app itself, design probes, or judge findings — that is the `explorer` agent (composing `heuristics` and `oracles`); this command dispatches and aggregates only.
- Override the explorer's absolute safety boundary — it exercises the app non-destructively, on authorized non-production targets only. This command gates that boundary up front but never relaxes it.
- Execute against an unauthorized or production target — it refuses and degrades to plan-only instead.
- Fabricate findings — an unparseable or blocked session is reported as such; nothing is invented for it.
- Auto-run or chain into another command after the debrief, or modify any file other than an optional written debrief.
