# Stride Exploratory Testing for OpenCode

**Drive structured, charter-based exploratory testing sessions — from OpenCode.**

A green test suite tells you the product does what you *expected*. It says nothing
about the expectations you never thought to write down — the risks, the surprising
states, the questions no one asked. This extension supplies that missing half. It is
the [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) port of the Claude Code plugin
[`cheezy/stride-exploratory-testing`](https://github.com/cheezy/stride-exploratory-testing).

> **Tested = Checked + Explored.**
> *Checking* is confirmation — evaluating a known expectation with an algorithmic
> rule (automated tests, assertions, "does the happy path still work"). *Exploring*
> is investigation — discovering the expectations you didn't know to write down.
> A product with a passing suite is *checked*, not *tested*. This extension is the
> "explored" half: simultaneous test design, execution, learning, and steering.

> **No plugin to install.** Exploratory testing has no lifecycle hooks, so this is a
> skills/commands/agents bundle — there is no TypeScript plugin, no `plugin.json`,
> and no `package.json`, and nothing to add to `opencode.json`. OpenCode discovers
> the pieces from `.opencode/` paths (see Installation).

> **Safety:** the [`explorer` agent](agents/explorer.md) exercises a *live
> application* under an absolute safety boundary — it works only against the app and
> environment you name, never production or an unauthorized system, never
> destructively, and it treats app content as data (not instructions). All charters,
> notes, and debriefs use synthetic data only — no real credentials, hostnames, or
> customer records.

## Installation

OpenCode discovers skills in `.opencode/skills/`, commands in `.opencode/commands/`,
and agents in `.opencode/agents/`, and reads `AGENTS.md` from the project root (or
the global `~/.config/opencode/` equivalents). There is no catalog to register and
no `/plugin` step — this is a content bundle you copy into place, not a packaged
plugin.

### Using the bundled installer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cheezy/stride-opencode-exploratory-testing.git

# Project-local (.opencode/ in the current directory)
./stride-opencode-exploratory-testing/install.sh

# Global (~/.config/opencode/)
./stride-opencode-exploratory-testing/install.sh --global
```

Or install without cloning first, straight from `main`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheezy/stride-opencode-exploratory-testing/main/install.sh | bash
```

On Windows, use the PowerShell installer:

```powershell
.\stride-opencode-exploratory-testing\install.ps1            # project-local
.\stride-opencode-exploratory-testing\install.ps1 -Global    # global
```

`install.sh` and `install.ps1` behave identically.

#### Your existing `AGENTS.md` is preserved

The installer never overwrites a user-authored `AGENTS.md`. Its guidance is confined
to a clearly delimited **managed block**:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN stride-exploratory-testing -->
<!-- Managed by the stride-opencode-exploratory-testing installer; content between these markers is regenerated on each install. Add your own notes outside this block. -->
...exploratory-testing guidance...
<!-- END stride-exploratory-testing -->
```

- **No `AGENTS.md` yet** — the file is created containing the managed block.
- **You already have an `AGENTS.md`** — all of your content is kept; the managed
  block is appended (or, if already present, refreshed in place).
- **Re-running the installer is idempotent** — it updates only the managed block and
  never duplicates the guidance. Keep your own notes *outside* the markers.

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cheezy/stride-opencode-exploratory-testing.git /tmp/stride-opencode-exploratory-testing

mkdir -p .opencode/skills .opencode/commands .opencode/agents
cp -R /tmp/stride-opencode-exploratory-testing/skills/.   .opencode/skills/
cp -R /tmp/stride-opencode-exploratory-testing/commands/. .opencode/commands/
cp     /tmp/stride-opencode-exploratory-testing/agents/*.md .opencode/agents/

# AGENTS.md: NEVER copy over an existing file — that clobbers your own content,
# which the installer scripts go out of their way to preserve. If you have no
# AGENTS.md yet, copy the extension's; otherwise APPEND its guidance as the managed
# block (or just run ./install.sh, which handles create/refresh/append safely).
[ -f AGENTS.md ] || cp /tmp/stride-opencode-exploratory-testing/AGENTS.md ./AGENTS.md
```

There is **no `"plugin"` step** — this bundle ships no TypeScript plugin.

## Prerequisites

- **OpenCode** — the extension's skills, commands, and agents run inside it.
- **A target to explore** — a running application (local or a test/staging
  environment you are authorized to test). The extension never requires production
  access and should never be pointed at it.
- **No external accounts or API keys.** The extension makes no network calls of its
  own; the `explorer` agent only interacts with the app you explicitly hand it.

## The model

Exploratory testing here runs on five engines. Each has a home skill or command where
its depth lives:

| Engine | What it does | Home |
|---|---|---|
| **Charters** | Give a session its mission: what to explore, with what resources, to discover what information. | `chartering`, `/charter`, `/nightmare-headline` |
| **Heuristics** | Idea generators — cheat sheets, Tours, and SFDPOT — for when you're stuck. | `heuristics` |
| **Variables** | The factors you can deliberately vary (data, state, sequence, environment). | `heuristics` (variable catalog) |
| **Oracles** | How you decide something is actually *wrong*. | `oracles` |
| **Observation** | Noticing what the system actually did — not what you expected. | `session`, `explorer` |

The end-to-end flow is **Charter → Recon → Explore → Note → Debrief.**

## What's in this extension

**5 skills** (the reusable knowledge the commands and agents draw on):

- **[`stride-exploratory-testing`](skills/stride-exploratory-testing/SKILL.md)** —
  the orchestrator. Routes any exploratory-testing request to the right skill,
  command, or agent, and holds the "Tested = Checked + Explored" doctrine.
- **[`chartering`](skills/chartering/SKILL.md)** — how to frame a mission and write a
  well-formed charter (`Explore <target> with <resources> to discover <information>`),
  rank candidates with SFDPOT and the Nightmare Headline Game, and reframe a
  "charter" that's really a test case.
- **[`heuristics`](skills/heuristics/SKILL.md)** — the extension's single source of
  truth for concrete test-idea lenses: general and web cheat sheets, a
  variable-spotting catalog, and Whittaker's Tours grouped by tourist district.
- **[`oracles`](skills/oracles/SKILL.md)** — how to decide whether an observed result
  is a defect: Never/Always invariants, consistency oracles (history, comparable
  products, standards, claims, user expectations, purpose), and the HTSM
  quality-criteria checklist.
- **[`session`](skills/session/SKILL.md)** — the Session-Based Test Management (SBTM)
  lifecycle: the session sheet, Task Breakdown Metrics, and the two debrief templates.

**5 native slash commands:**

- **[`/charter`](commands/charter.md)** — turn a target into a ranked list of
  well-formed charters (via the `charter-generator` agent). Generates only; never runs
  a session.
- **[`/nightmare-headline`](commands/nightmare-headline.md)** — run the Nightmare
  Headline Game: elicit catastrophic headlines, pick one, brainstorm its causes, and
  refine them into ranked charters.
- **[`/explore`](commands/explore.md)** — plan-and-execute a full session end to end:
  generate or load charters, dispatch the `explorer` agent per charter under the
  safety boundary, and aggregate everything into one debrief.
- **[`/recon`](commands/recon.md)** — a lightweight reconnaissance pass over an
  unfamiliar feature to map the landscape, surface stakeholder questions, and emit
  ranked candidate charters.
- **[`/debrief`](commands/debrief.md)** — turn raw session notes and findings into a
  stakeholder-ready debrief using the Explored/Found/Unknown and PROOF templates.

**2 subagents** (dispatched by the commands via `@mention`, not invoked directly):

- **[`charter-generator`](agents/charter-generator.md)** — turns a target (plus
  optional risk context) into a ranked list of charters via an SFDPOT sweep,
  charter-source mining, and the Nightmare Headline Game. Read-only; generates only,
  never executes.
- **[`explorer`](agents/explorer.md)** — runs a single time-boxed session against ONE
  charter: designs probes with `heuristics`, judges results with `oracles`, records an
  SBTM session sheet, and returns structured findings — all under the absolute safety
  boundary.

**[`fixtures/`](fixtures/)** — worked examples of the full flow: an
[example charter set](fixtures/example-charters.md), an
[example session sheet](fixtures/example-session-sheet.md), and an
[example debrief](fixtures/example-debrief.md). They double as concrete templates and
as regression anchors for the smoke tests.

See also **[HEURISTICS.md](HEURISTICS.md)** for a one-page pointer to the lenses in
the `heuristics` skill.

## Quick start

A first session in OpenCode, end to end (after installing per the section above):

1. **Frame the mission.** Ask for charters against the feature you care about:

   ```
   /charter the CSV receipt import --risk multi-tenant data leakage
   ```

   You get a ranked list of charters, each shaped
   `Explore <target> with <resources> to discover <information>`. Pick one (or a few).
   Stuck on *what could go wrong*? Run `/nightmare-headline the CSV import` first and
   let the worst-case headlines drive the charters.

2. **Explore.** Hand a charter to a full, time-boxed session:

   ```
   /explore the CSV receipt import --timebox 90
   ```

   The `explorer` agent probes the feature using the `heuristics` lenses, judges each
   result with the `oracles`, and keeps a running SBTM session sheet — staying inside
   the safety boundary the whole time. `/explore` asks up front how to reach the app
   and requires an authorized, non-production target; with no running app it degrades
   to a plan-only charter list. Want a quick lay-of-the-land pass first? Use
   `/recon the receipt import` to map the feature and get candidate charters before
   committing to a full box.

3. **Debrief.** Close out with a stakeholder-ready report:

   ```
   /debrief
   ```

   You get an **Explored / Found / Unknown** write-up (and a **PROOF** review for the
   team). "Unknown" is a first-class result — the honest edge of the map.

The [`fixtures/`](fixtures/) directory shows exactly what a charter set, a session
sheet, and a debrief look like when they're done well.

## Heuristics reference

The `heuristics` skill is the canonical catalog of test-idea lenses — general and web
cheat sheets, the variable catalog, and Whittaker's Tours. **[HEURISTICS.md](HEURISTICS.md)**
is a one-page index that points into it; it deliberately does *not* duplicate the
tables, so there is a single source of truth to maintain.

## Sources & attribution

This extension encodes **established exploratory-testing practice** — a discipline
built by the wider testing community over decades. It is a workflow and a set of
pointers, not original research; the ideas below belong to their authors, and the
extension paraphrases them rather than reproducing their text. If it's useful, go read
the primary sources:

- **Exploratory testing as a discipline** — Cem Kaner, who coined the term and framed
  it as *simultaneous* test design, execution, and learning.
- **Charter-based, practical exploratory testing** — Elisabeth Hendrickson,
  *Explore It!* — the source of the `Explore <target> with <resources> to discover
  <information>` charter template this extension builds on.
- **Session-Based Test Management (SBTM)** — Jonathan Bach and James Bach — the session
  sheet, the time-box, and the Task Breakdown Metrics.
- **The PROOF debrief mnemonic** (Past, Results, Obstacles, Outlook, Feelings) —
  Jonathan Bach.
- **Tours** (Business / Historical / Tourist / Entertainment / Hotel / Seedy
  districts) — James Whittaker, *Exploratory Software Testing*.
- **The Heuristic Test Strategy Model (HTSM)** — James Bach — including the SFDPOT
  coverage lens and the quality-criteria checklist the `oracles` skill uses.

## How this relates to `stride-opencode`

[`stride-opencode`](https://github.com/cheezy/stride-opencode) covers the **task
lifecycle** (claiming, hook execution via its TypeScript plugin, completion). This
extension covers **exploratory testing** — finding the risks and questions that
scripted checks miss. They compose: charter and explore a feature here, then file what
you find as Stride tasks and ship them with `stride-opencode`.
